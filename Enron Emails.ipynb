This is the letter \\nthat I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at \\nmy church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of \\nour church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage \\nyou to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the \\neffectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly \\nstated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and \\nwe will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try \\nto meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have \\nreceived along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, \\ngovernment and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really \\ndon't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us \\naround that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt \\nwe hurt. : )\\n\\n\\nI am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me\\nthis week.\\n\\nFor the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a\\nlump I found\\nunder my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an\\nultrasound of\\nmy breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist\\nthis week to\\ndetermine if I need to have a biopsy or not.\\n\\nSince God has given me the task of\\ndoing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.\\n\\nI trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several\\nmonths\\nago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our\\nfamily,\\nwe have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you\\nat\\nthis time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten\\nmad.  So he\\nhas decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought\\ndown off this\\nspiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.\\n\\nThat is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors\\nI need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on\\nThursday\\nand I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.\\n\\nGod Bless Each of you\\nand\\nSeason's Greetings\\n\\nLove\\n\\nMarylyn\\n________________________________________________________________\\nGET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!\\nJuno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!\\nJoin Juno today!
