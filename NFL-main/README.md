Predictive Analysis of NFL Defense Schemes
This project was inciated with the idea to participate in the NFL Kaggle competetion, after this idea, it turned on a school project where we wanted to determine best defense schemes for a team
with this stude we attempt to generate a model that use selected features to predict the result of a play, identified by yard gaining or no yard gaining. Using 3 different classification models, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and Random Forest we will predict the outcome of a play, in our study the selected model was Random Forest Classifier based on accuracy, recall and f1 results. Getting a prediction accuracy of 0.8938 the 50 selected features can give us the prediction of yards gained or no yards gained.
