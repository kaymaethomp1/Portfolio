Predictive Analysis of NFL Defense Schemes
This project was a group project based on an NFL Kaggle competetion. The goal of the project was to work as a team to create a model which has the ability determine best defense schemes for a team based on what the offense puts on the field. We use the features that were selected by the model to predict the result of the play which would allow the defensive coordinator to determine the best scheme for his team to ensure a play with zero yards gained. Three different classification models were tested: logistic regression, KNN, and Random Forest. After testing, the best performing model is Random Forest Classifier based on accuracy, recall and F1 results. This model produced a prediction accuracy of 0.8938 using the 50 selected features to give us the prediction of yards gained or no yards gained.
